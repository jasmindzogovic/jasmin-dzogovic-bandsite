                            The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating
                            from San Francisco, California. The band
                            consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist
                            Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist
                            Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The
                            band achieved its first commercial success as
                            an unsigned act, drawing attention from
                            manager Cam Adams. Having worked with
                            other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room,
                            One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was
                            confident the band could succeed even further,
                            pushing them to sign with Magenta Records.</p>
                        <p class="main__container-second-paragraph">
                            From there, the band has soared, gaining
                            international recognition and ranking in the
                            top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans
                            immediately fell in love with the band’s original
                            and organic attitude, solidifying their place as
                            one of the hottest and fastest up and coming
                            acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to
                            themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to
                            their candid and authentic performances on
                            stage. Looking forward to touring in the future,
                            The Bees Knees are currently recording their
                            second studio album, looking to be released in
                            late 2021.
